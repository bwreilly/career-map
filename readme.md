# Career Projections

## What
Simple API and visualization for [state-by-state occupation projections from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)](http://www.projectionscentral.com/Projections/LongTerm). This will include:

1. Base number of jobs as of 2010
2. Change in number of jobs
3. Percent of change
4. Average annual openings

## Why

My partner was looking into a variety of different engineering degrees, and I wanted to show where the jobs were for those options.

## What's with South Dakota?

Couldn't find anything for South Dakota. Perhaps they declined to participate. If anyone happens to know where to find it, I would be happy to add it in.

## Contribute

The front end particularly is very much a work in progress. Pull requests welcome.

## Rights

BLS data is public domain. Go nuts.
